<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Ian Simiyu Makokha. I was born and raised in Uasin Gishu County
  in a town called Eldoret in Kenya.
  My education performance was one to be envied by many but when I joined
  university is when I realized education is not my thing at all.

  I used to be facinated by computers a lot after completing my high school education.
  And so I decided to drop out of campus and persue my life's biggest desire, coding.
  Currently am doing well and one day I know I shall become a successful software engineer.
